---

## Troubleshooting Lockouts in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Identify the Problem

- Look for **"Yes"** in the **"Locked Out"** column
- Check **"Bad Pwd Count"** - high numbers indicate multiple attempts
- Note the **"Last Bad Password Time"** - this shows when it happened

### Step 2: Find the Source

The DC with the **most recent** "Last Bad Password Time" is receiving the bad password attempts.

**Common sources:**
- üíª Mapped network drives
- üì± Mobile devices (phones, tablets)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Scheduled tasks
- üñ•Ô∏è Services running as the user
- üåê Web browsers with saved passwords
- üìß Email clients (Outlook)

### Step 3: Take Action

1. **Unlock the account** using "Unlock on All DCs" button
2. **Reset password** if needed
3. **Find and fix** the source of bad passwords (don't just keep unlocking!)
